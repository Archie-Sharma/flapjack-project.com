  %p 
    %em Flapjack 
    is a scalable and distributed monitoring system. It natively talks the
    Nagios plugin format, and can easily be scaled from 1 server to 1000.
  %p 
    %em Flapjack 
    tries to adhere to the following tenets: 
  %ul 
    %li it should be simple to set up, configure, and maintain
    %li it should easily scale from a single host to multiple
    %li writing and sharing checks should be quick and obvious

      The populator grabs checks out of a bunch of different sources and inserts
      them into a
      %a{:href => "http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/"} Beanstalkd
      jobs queue. 
    %p 
      Workers then:
      %ol
        %li pop a check off the jobs queue
        %li do the check
        %li put the result onto the results queue
        %li put the job back onto the jobs queue
