%div#what
  %p 
    %em Flapjack 
    is a scalable and distributed monitoring system. It natively talks the
    Nagios plugin format, and can easily be scaled from 1 server to 1000.
  %p 
    %em Flapjack 
    tries to adhere to the following tenets: 
  %ul 
    %li it should be simple to set up, configure, and maintain
    %li it should easily scale from a single host to multiple
    %li writing and sharing checks should be quick and obvious
    
  %p
    You can check out a
    %a{:href => "http://demo-admin.flapjack-project.com/"} demo
    of the admin interface.

            $ flapjack-worker-manager start
    %li
      %p

        notifies people if the check results are bad.
      %p 
        Use 
        %code flapjack-notifier-manager 
        to start and stop 
        %code flapjack-notifier
        as a daemon.
