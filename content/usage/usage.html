%h1 Using Flapjack
%div#usage
  %p
    %em Flapjack 
    consists of several components that&nbsp;
    %a{:href => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"}> do one thing and do it well
    \:
  %img{:src => "/images/flapjack-architecture.png", :class => 'architecture', :alt => 'architecture diagram'}
  %ul
    %li
      %code flapjack-admin
      lets you configure checks through a web interface.
    %li
      %code flapjack-notifier
      notifies people if the check results are bad.
    %li
      %code flapjack-worker
      executes the checks and reports back results. 
    %li 
      %code beanstalkd
      is a work queue used to distribute checks and results.

  %div#flapjack-worker
    %h2.flapjack-worker.component
      %span flapjack-worker
    %p 
      You can use 
      %code flapjack-worker-manager
      to start a cluster of workers (5 by default):
      %blockquote.commands
        %pre 
          $ flapjack-worker-manager start
    %p 
      %code flapjack-worker-manager 
      can be called multiple times to start more workers, for 
      instance:
      %blockquote.commands
        %pre 
          :preserve
            $ flapjack-worker-manager start --workers=10
            $ flapjack-worker-manager start --workers=15
    %p 
      will start 25 workers. 
    %p 
      Calling 
      %code flapjack-worker-manager
      with 
      %code stop 
      %blockquote.commands
        %pre 
          :preserve
            $ flapjack-worker-manager stop
    %p 
      will shutdown all running workers.
    %p 
      If you want to run a 
      %code flapjack-worker
      interactively, just run: 
      %blockquote.commands
        %pre 
          :preserve
            $ flapjack-worker
            ^C
    %p
      You can use this to see what's going on behind the scenes. The 
      worker manager is just spawning multiple copies of
      %code flapjack-worker.
    %p      
      To find out what options can be passed to the worker, run: 
      %blockquote.commands
        %pre 
          :preserve
            $ flapjack-worker --help

  %div#flapjack-notifier
    %h2.flapjack-notifier.component
      %span flapjack-notifier
    %p 
      Use 
      %code flapjack-notifier-manager 
      to start and stop 
      %code flapjack-notifier
      as a daemon. 
      %blockquote.commands
        %pre 
          $ flapjack-notifier-manager start
    %p 
      Right now you can only run one 
      %code flapjack-notifier
      as a daemon at a time. 
    %p 
      Like&nbsp; 
      %code> flapjack-worker
      , you can run 
      %code flapjack-notifier
      interactively:
      %blockquote.commands
        %pre 
          :preserve
            $ flapjack-notifier
            ^C
    %p      
      You can also get a list of options to pass to the notifier: 
      %blockquote.commands
        %pre 
          :preserve
            $ flapjack-notifier --help
        
  %div#flapjack-admin
    %h2.flapjack-admin.component
      %span flapjack-admin
    %p
      Grab the 
      %a{:href => "http://github.com/auxesis/flapjack-admin/tree/master#readme"} flapjack-admin 
      web interface to start configuring checks, then use the 
      %code flapjack-populator
      included with 
      %code flapjack-admin
      to start running the checks:
      %blockquote.commands
        %pre 
          :preserve
            $ cd path/to/flapjack-admin
            $ bin/flapjack-populator
    %p
      This will take the checks you set up in 
      %code flapjack-admin
      and turn them into jobs on the 
      %code beanstalkd
      work queue.
    %p 
      Provided the workers are running, they will start running the new
      checks.
    %p 
      If you have existing checks in the 
      %code beanstalkd
      work queue, you need to restart it before running the populator 
      again. As 
      %code beanstalkd 
      is an in-memory work queue, the restart will wipe all existing
      jobs, leaving a clean slate to run the
      %code flapjack-populator
      again.
  
  %div#distributing
    %h2 Distributing
  %p
    When you ran 
    %code install-flapjack-systemwide 
    during the install, init scripts were placed in&nbsp;
    %code> /etc/init.d
    \. Additionally, if you run Ubuntu or Debian, they were
    set to start on boot.
  %p
    Each init script has a corresponding control file in 
    %code /etc/default/
    that can be used to set default options when starting &amp;
    stopping daemons. 

  %p
    You can use these to start up the different parts of 
    %em Flapjack
    depending on what role the system should play. 
    
  %p
    For instance, you might want to run a worker cluster on one 
    machine and the notifier on another. This can be a great 
    way of distributing the load when you have lots of checks.
  %p 
    You can run worker clusters across many machines too, providing
    failover if one of your clusters goes down. This also works for 
    the notifier.
